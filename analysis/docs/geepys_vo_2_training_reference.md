# VO₂ / Threshold Training — Printable Reference

**Athlete:** Peter  
**Context:** BikeErg / SkiErg, masters endurance physiology

---

## 1. Core Findings (from personal data)

- Heart rate (HR) rises **slowly** at onset of hard work
- HR **stays elevated** once fatigued
- HR recovery during short rests **collapses late** in successful sessions
- Absolute max HR is **not required** for strong VO₂ stimulus

**Interpretation**
- High stroke volume, strong aerobic base
- Leg-limited before cardiopulmonary-limited
- Slow HR kinetics are a **feature**, not a deficit

---

## 2. Locked Definitions

### 2.1 Session Max HR
**Definition:** Highest HR observed **after warmup**, during work intervals.
- Day-specific
- Modality-specific
- Reference only (not a target)

---

### 2.2 High Cardiovascular Load (HCL)
**Definition:**
> Time with **HR ≥ 90% of session max HR**

**Measures:**
- Overall cardiac workload
- Sustained cardiac output demand

**Does NOT guarantee:**
- VO₂ ceiling exposure

---

### 2.3 VO₂ Stimulus (Central / Late Phase)
**Primary adaptation metric**

**Definition:**
> Time spent where **autonomic recovery is impaired**, identified by:
> **HR_drop ≤ ~2 bpm over a 30s easy interval**

Represents:
- Parasympathetic withdrawal
- Sympathetic dominance
- Cardiac output near ceiling
- Oxygen delivery no longer catching up

---

### 2.4 HR_drop (Recovery Slope)
**Definition:**
```
HR_drop = HR(start of easy) − HR(end of easy)
```

Measured over standard easy interval (e.g. 30s).

Interpretation:
- ≥8 bpm → recovery intact (early)
- 4–6 bpm → recovery degrading (mid)
- ≤2 bpm → recovery collapsed (**late / VO₂**)

---

### 2.5 Early / Mid / Late Phases (state-based)

| Phase | HR_drop | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Early | ≥7–8 bpm | Setup / peripheral |
| Mid | 3–6 bpm | Transition |
| Late | ≤2 bpm | **True VO₂ stimulus** |

Notes:
- Phases are physiological states, not time-based thirds
- A session may enter late phase early, late, or never

---

## 3. Example: 12/26 BikeErg Session

- Session max HR ≈ 146 bpm
- HR ≥90% max (≥131 bpm): **~19.5 min** (HCL)
- HR recovery collapsed (late phase): **~9–10 min** (VO₂ stimulus)

**Interpretation:**
- ~19.5 min high cardiovascular load
- ~9–10 min true VO₂ stimulus
- Session successful because late phase was reached and sustained

---

## 4. Threshold Anchors

### 4.1 Zone 2 (lactate-verified)
- ~150 W (BikeErg)
- Lactate ~1.5–2.0 mmol
- Strong clearance

---

### 4.2 FLT (Functional Lactate Threshold)
Estimated by bracketing Z2 clearance and VO₂ accumulation:
- **~175–185 W**
- Center ≈ **180 W**

---

### 4.3 FTP (Functional Threshold Power)
For this athlete:
- FTP ≈ FLT or slightly above
- Likely **~180–185 W**
- Ramp tests may overestimate

**Working FTP:** **180 W**

---

## 5. Metrics to Trend

### Primary (most important)
1. **VO₂ Stimulus Time (min)**
   - Time with HR_drop ≤2 bpm
   - Target: **8–12 min per session**

2. **Weekly VO₂ Stimulus (min)**
   - Sum of late-phase minutes
   - Target: **15–25 min / week**

---

### Secondary (context)
3. **High Cardiovascular Load Time**
   - HR ≥90% session max

4. **Time to Late Phase**
   - Minutes or reps until HR_drop collapses

5. **Session Survivability**
   - Did legs fail before late phase? (Yes/No)

---

### Optional (advanced)
6. **HR_drop Decay Slope**
   - Speed of recovery degradation

7. **VO₂ Efficiency**
```
VO₂ stimulus time / total hard time
```

---

## 6. What Not to Chase

- Absolute max HR
- Faster HR response
- HRV during exercise
- Respiratory rate metrics

---

## 7. Operating Principle (keep this)

> **Design sessions so the legs survive long enough for HR recovery to collapse, then accumulate 8–12 minutes in that state. Judge success post-hoc, not in real time.**
